          This document serves as a reference for the HTML syntax, vocabulary
          and its associated DOM APIs and is intended for web site and
          application developers, publishers, tutorial writers and teachers and
          their students. That is, people who write documents using HTML, or who
          teach others to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide is structured into three major sections. The first provides
          a set of basic templates for authors to get started with.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second section provides an in depth look at the syntax of HTML and
          XHTML documents. This will investigate both the similarities and
          differences between the two alternatives and provides guidance on
          choosing which to use for your own projects, depending on your needs.
          Additionally, this will also provide details about creating polyglot
          documents — that is, documents that conform to both HTML and XHTML
          simultaneiously — including issues related to ensuring stylesheets and
          scripts work correctly under both conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third and final section provides a reference for the HTML
          vocabulary. Each element is described, providing details about its its
          meaning, allowed attributes, content models and DOM APIs. Each is
          accompanied by clear examples illustrating how the element is designed
          to be used for a range of different use cases.

      <section id="Basic_Templates" class="main-section">
        <header>Basic Templates</header>
        <p>
          The following basic templates are designed to be used as starting
          points for the documents you create. Several alternatives are
          provided, allowing individuals to choose the template that is most
          appropriate for their needs.

        <p>
          It is useful to make a distinction between the vocabulary of an HTML
          document—the elements and attributes, and their meanings—and the
          syntax in which it is written.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML has a defined set of elements and attributes which can be used in
          a document; each designed for a specific purpose with their own
          meaning. Consider this set of elements to be analogous to the list of
          words in a dictionary. This includes elements for headings,
          paragraphs, lists, tables, links, form controls and many other
          features. This is the vocabulary of HTML. Similarly, just as natural
          languages have grammatical rules for how different words can be used,
          HTML has rules for where and how each element and attribute can be
          used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The basic structure of elements in an HTML document is a tree
          structure. Most elements have at most one parent element, (except for
          the root element), and may have any number of child elements. This
          structure needs to be reflected in the syntax used to write the
          document.

          Each element in HTML falls into zero or more categories that group
          elements with similar characteristics together. The following
          categories are used in this guide:

        <p>
          Some elements have unique requirements and do not fit into any
          particular category.
