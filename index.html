          Ionic Framework focuses on the frontend UX and UI interaction of an
          app — UI controls, interactions, gestures, animations. It's easy to
          learn, and integrates with other libraries or frameworks, such as
          Angular, React, or Vue. Alternatively, it can be used standalone
          without any frontend framework using a simple script include. If you’d
          like to learn more about Ionic Framework before diving in, we created
          a video to walk you through the basics.
        </p>
        <h2>One codebase, running everywhere</h2>
        <p>
          Ionic is the only mobile app stack that enables web developers to
          build apps for all major app stores and the mobile web from a single
          codebase. And with Adaptive Styling, Ionic apps look and feel at home
          on every device.
        </p>
        <h2>A focus on performance</h2>
        <p>
          Ionic is built to perform and behave great on the latest mobile
          devices with best practices like efficient hardware accelerated
          transitions, and touch-optimized gestures.
        </p>
        <h2>Clean, simple, and functional design</h2>
        <p>
          Ionic is designed to work and display beautifully on all current
          mobile devices and platforms. With ready-made components, typography,
          and a gorgeous (yet extensible) base theme that adapts to each
          platform, you'll be building in style.
        </p>
        <h2>Native and Web optimized</h2>
        <p>
          Ionic emulates native app UI guidelines and uses native SDKs, bringing
          the UI standards and device features of native apps together with the
          full power and flexibility of the open web. Ionic uses Capacitor (or
          Cordova) to deploy natively, or runs in the browser as a Progressive
          Web App.
        </p>

        <p>
          To get started with Ionic Framework, the only requirement is a Node &
          npm environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, a code editor is also required. Visual Studio Code is
          recommended. Visual Studio Code is a free, batteries-included text
          editor made by Microsoft.
        </p>
        <h2>Terminal</h2>
        <p>
          In general, we recommend using the built-in terminals. Many
          third-party terminals work well with Ionic, but may not be supported.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For Windows, Command Prompt and PowerShell are supported. WSL is
            known to work with Ionic, but may not be supported.
          </li>
          <li>For macOS, the built-in Terminal app is supported.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Git Bash (from git-scm.com) does not support TTY interactivity and is
          not supported by Ionic
        </p>
        <h2>Node & npm</h2>
        <p>
          Almost all tooling for modern JavaScript projects is based in Node.js.
          The download page has prebuilt installation packages for all
          platforms. We recommend selecting the LTS version to ensure best
          compatibility.
        </p>
        <p>Node is bundled with npm, the package manager for JavaScript.</p>
        <p>To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:</p>
        <pre><code>$ node --version
$ npm --version</code></pre>
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <p>
          Although not required, the version control system Git is highly
          recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Git is often accompanied by a Git Host, such as GitHub, in which case
          additional setup is required. Follow the tutorial from the Git Host's
          documentation to set up Git:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub: Set up Git</li>
          <li>GitLab: Installing Git</li>
          <li>Bitbucket: Install Git</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Otherwise, follow the official installation instructions. The
          command-line utility can be downloaded from the download page.
        </p>
        <p>To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:</p>
        <pre><code>$ git --version</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section id="CLI_Installation" class="main-section">
        <header>CLI Installation</header>
        <p>
          Ionic apps are created and developed primarily through the Ionic
          command-line utility. The Ionic CLI is the preferred method of
          installation, as it offers a wide range of dev tools and help options
          along the way. It is also the main tool through which to run the app
          and connect it to other services, such as Ionic Appflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before proceeding, make sure your computer has Node.js installed. See
          these instructions to set up an environment for Ionic.
        </p>
        <p>Install the Ionic CLI with npm:</p>
        <pre><code>$ npm install -g @ionic/cli</code></pre>
        <p>
          f there was a previous installation of the Ionic CLI, it will need to
          be uninstalled due to a change in package name.
        </p>
        <pre><code>$ npm uninstall -g ionic 
$ npm install -g @ionic/cli</code></pre>
        <h2>Start an App</h2>
        <p>
          Create an Ionic app using one of the pre-made app templates, or a
          blank one to start fresh. The three most common starters are the blank
          starter, tabs starter, and sidemenu starter. Get started with the
          ionic start command:
        </p>
        <pre><code>$ ionic start myApp tabs</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section id="Packages_&_CDN" class="main-section">
        <header>Packages & CDN</header>
        <p>
          Ionic provides different packages that can be used to quickly get
          started using Ionic Framework or Ionicons in a test environment,
          Angular, any other framework, or none at all.
        </p>
        <h2>Ionic Framework CDN</h2>
        <p>
          Ionic Framework can be included from a CDN for quick testing in a
          Plunker, Codepen, or any other online code editor!
        </p>
        <p>
          It's recommended to use jsdelivr to access the Framework from a CDN.
          To get the latest version, add the following inside the &lt;head&gt;
          element in an HTML file, or where external assets are included in the
          online code editor:
        </p>
        <p>
          With this it's possible to use all of the Ionic Framework core
          components without having to install a framework. The CSS bundle will
          include all of the Ionic Global Stylesheets.
        </p>
        <h2>Ionic + Angular</h2>
        <p>
          When using Ionic Framework in an Angular project, install the latest
          @ionic/angular package from npm. This comes with all of the Ionic
          Framework components and Angular specific services and features.
        </p>
        <pre><code>$ npm install @ionic/angular@latest --save</code></pre>
        <p>
          Each time there is a new Ionic Framework release, this version will
          need to be updated to get the latest features and fixes. The version
          can be updated using npm, as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          For adding Ionic to an already existing Angular project, use the
          Angular CLI's ng add feature.
        </p>
        <pre><code>$ ng add @ionic/angular</code></pre>
        <p>
          This will add the necessary imports to the @ionic/angular package as
          well as add the styles needed.
        </p>
