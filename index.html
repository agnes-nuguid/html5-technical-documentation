          Ionic Framework focuses on the frontend UX and UI interaction of an
          app — UI controls, interactions, gestures, animations. It's easy to
          learn, and integrates with other libraries or frameworks, such as
          Angular, React, or Vue. Alternatively, it can be used standalone
          without any frontend framework using a simple script include. If you’d
          like to learn more about Ionic Framework before diving in, we created
          a video to walk you through the basics.
        </p>
        <h2>One codebase, running everywhere</h2>
        <p>
          Ionic is the only mobile app stack that enables web developers to
          build apps for all major app stores and the mobile web from a single
          codebase. And with Adaptive Styling, Ionic apps look and feel at home
          on every device.
        </p>
        <h2>A focus on performance</h2>
        <p>
          Ionic is built to perform and behave great on the latest mobile
          devices with best practices like efficient hardware accelerated
          transitions, and touch-optimized gestures.
        </p>
        <h2>Clean, simple, and functional design</h2>
        <p>
          Ionic is designed to work and display beautifully on all current
          mobile devices and platforms. With ready-made components, typography,
          and a gorgeous (yet extensible) base theme that adapts to each
          platform, you'll be building in style.
        </p>
        <h2>Native and Web optimized</h2>
        <p>
          Ionic emulates native app UI guidelines and uses native SDKs, bringing
          the UI standards and device features of native apps together with the
          full power and flexibility of the open web. Ionic uses Capacitor (or
          Cordova) to deploy natively, or runs in the browser as a Progressive
          Web App.

          To get started with Ionic Framework, the only requirement is a Node &
          npm environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, a code editor is also required. Visual Studio Code is
          recommended. Visual Studio Code is a free, batteries-included text
          editor made by Microsoft.
        </p>
        <h2>Terminal</h2>
        <p>
          In general, we recommend using the built-in terminals. Many
          third-party terminals work well with Ionic, but may not be supported.
        </p>
        <p>
          Git Bash (from git-scm.com) does not support TTY interactivity and is
          not supported by Ionic
        </p>
        <h2>Node & npm</h2>
        <p>
          Almost all tooling for modern JavaScript projects is based in Node.js.
          The download page has prebuilt installation packages for all
          platforms. We recommend selecting the LTS version to ensure best
          compatibility.
        </p>
        <p>Node is bundled with npm, the package manager for JavaScript.</p>
        <p>To verify the installation, open a new terminal window and run:</p>
